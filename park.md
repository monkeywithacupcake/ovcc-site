# Olympic View Park 

Take a hike, right in our neighborhood! Walk through the tall trees on several groomed trails.

After 20 years of dedicated work by neighbors, State and County officials the 46 acre lot of land on the corners of Olympic View Rd, Olympic View Loop Rd and Jupiter Trail has now transferred from the DNR to Kitsap County Parks Department. The neighbors and County are now working together in a stewardship program for the land. 


You may contact the [Park Stewardship Coordinator](https://www.kitsapgov.com/parks/Pages/Volunteer.aspx), to learn more of how you can become involved (360-337-5372).
