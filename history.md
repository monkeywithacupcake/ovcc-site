The Olympic View Community Club was founded in 1930 to provide a meeting place for the community. The first meeting was held in the home of Miro Boich. As the club began to take form, a regular meeting place became a must. Mr. Illich offered the use of his barn and from January 1931 to 1933 the barn was used for club meetings.  Mr. and Mrs. Bemis donated a quarter acre of land at the current location and fund raising began in earnest to build our current clubhouse. 


In January 1933 the new clubhouse was used. The wood stove was installed and for many happy hours friends have gathered around it's warmth. The bathrooms were not installed until 1949. During the following years numerous dances, card parities, plays, community meetings and  potlucks have kept the club a strong and vital part of the community. As with any organization there were periods of great activity and periods of slow times. In 1941 the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the community together and the club became a Civil Defense Post, manned 24 hours a day until March 1942. During the war years, the club was not as active, but afterwards many new people had moved to the area and the club was revitalized.

In 1948, the monthly potluck suppers began and continued until the late 1990's. During the years, the club has not only been a center for community fellowship, but it has also been a focal point of community awareness. Members have represented Olympic View on road improvement committees, first aid classes have been held there, earthquake preparedness center, the volunteer fire department was created in 1953, the bookmobile visits, Mother Day Breakfasts are held and numerous Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops have met. In 1959 the Puget Soundsters presented their first musical program at the club and that tradition continued for 40 years.  
In the recent years, the kitchen facilities and hall have been updated and repainted. To this day the club continues to be a center for community fellowship, community awareness and traditions to build our families on.
