The neighbors have gotten together and have begun the Neighborhood Watch Program in conjunction with the Kitsap County Sheriffs. We desire a neighborhood that is safe and pleasant to live in. 

The Sheriff department can assist you with securing your property. Please be on the lookout for suspicious/unusual/dangerous activities and report them to police by calling 911. It is important that the police know about things happening in our neighborhoods.  Please take time to view the Sheriff website.

## WHO TO CALL WHEN

- Roadside dumping -- **Kitsap One 360-337-5777**
